I wrote this game when I was 18, just a "desktop version" of a popular mobile game at that time. And It was also the time that I didn't know anything about concepts like "project structure", "design pattern",â€¦ So, I just wrote all the functions of this game in **a single C++ file** ðŸ˜….
And, do you know how did I control the source code versions? â€“ I used **Google mail** ðŸ˜….

In spite of the simple and "unclean" code, the game ran pretty well.  I usually played it in my freetime cause I didnâ€™t have smartphone at that time ðŸ˜‚, I shared it with some friends who didnâ€™t have smartphone like me (or someone had but still played my game just to try my "product" ðŸ˜‚)

Now I push it to Git repo just because I want to keep it as a good memory - of my first days in Danang, and share a little story with you ðŸ˜Š. I named the repository the same as the folder name 5 years ago ðŸ˜Š.

**Source code file:**

[main.cpp](main.cpp)

**How to run this game?**

Just run the [Game/2048YNWA.exe](Game/2048YNWA.exe)

**How I made the welcome screen logo:**
